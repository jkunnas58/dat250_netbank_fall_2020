3. Sensitive Data Exposure
Things to implement:

•	Encrypt all data in transit with secure protocols such as TLS with perfect forward secrecy (PFS) ciphers, cipher prioritization by the server, and secure parameters. 
  Enforce encryption using directives like HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS). Not sure how to do this one, maybe you guy know.
  
  
•	Sensitive data at rest (password in our case) must be encrypted. I saw that password is already encrypted. One extra thing that we can have is card/account number. 
  That one would also have to be encrypted. Good encryption methods: Argon2, scrypt, bcrypt or PBKDF2.
