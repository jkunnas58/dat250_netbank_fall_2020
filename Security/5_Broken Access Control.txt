5_Broken Access Control

Things to implement:

•	All our accounts have same power. There is no admin account. Maybe we should create an admin account with more control. 
  Like seeing how much money everyone has. Just an example. Can create and admin page that only admin can access. http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin.html

Things to check:

•	Have checked: Tried to access http://127.0.0.1:5000/logged_in_page.html after pushing Logout. Got and error. That is great.
•	Our addresses don’t have any http://127.0.0.1:5000/logged_in_page.html=id1, that is good. It means hacker cannot change ID on URL and access another user’s info.

Anything more we can check??
