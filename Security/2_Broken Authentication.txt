2.Broken Authentication

Things to implement: 
  •	multi-factor authentication (If possible)
  •	Weak-password checks(test against a list of the top 1000 worst(https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-1000.txt))
  •	Password length, complexity (number, upper/lower, special symbol like @ or!)
  •	failed login attempts (3) or time to wait until next try.
  •	Session timeouts: if user forgets to push logout and just closes the browser, he must be logged out automatically after some time. 
  
Scenarios to check after implementation:
  •	Check the list of known passwords
  •	Is there a multi-factor authentication?
  •	Check if user was logged out(session timeout)
